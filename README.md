## 📊 Project Overview
- Load and explore the dataset.
- Handle missing values and clean the data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize relationships between pay, job titles, and benefits.
- Build and evaluate regression models for salary prediction.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Distribution of salaries across job titles and agencies.
- Highest and lowest paid employees.
- Relationship between **BasePay, OvertimePay, Benefits** and **TotalPay**.
- Random Forest achieved very high performance with **R² ≈ 0.998**.
  ---

## 📈 Results
- **Linear Regression**: R² ≈ 0.993
- **Random Forest Regressor**: R² ≈ 0.998
- Random Forest performed slightly better with lower error metrics.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest.
- Try Gradient Boosting and XGBoost models.
- Deploy the model as a web app (e.g., Streamlit/Flask).
